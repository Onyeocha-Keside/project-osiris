# **PROJECT OSIRIS - Product Requirements Document**

**Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED - PUBLIC  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Status:** Draft - Community Review

---

## **Executive Summary**

Project OSIRIS develops the first AI platform capable of autonomous driving in chaotic emerging market environments. By combining synthetic data generation (MIRAGE) with culturally-intelligent driving AI (ATHENA), OSIRIS solves the $32B emerging market blind spot in autonomous vehicles.

**Mission**: Deploy autonomous vehicles in Lagos traffic by 2026.

---

## **Problem Statement**

### **Market Gap**
- 95% of AV training data comes from Western road conditions
- Current AV systems fail in chaotic traffic (okadas, informal infrastructure, cultural behaviors)
- $32B emerging market segment remains unserved
- Existing solutions require data center compute resources

### **Technical Challenges**
- No synthetic data for Lagos traffic scenarios
- No AI models understanding cultural traffic patterns  
- No edge-deployable solutions for resource constraints
- No frameworks for informal infrastructure navigation

```

**MIRAGE**: Generates Lagos traffic scenarios at 1/10th industry cost  
**ATHENA**: Makes real-time driving decisions using cultural intelligence

### **Unique Value Proposition**
- First AI that understands African traffic culture
- 10x more resource-efficient than existing solutions
- Validated by local Lagos driving experts
- Deployable on single edge device vs data centers
