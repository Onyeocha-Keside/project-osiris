## **Executive Summary**

The autonomous vehicle market exhibits a critical blind spot: **zero major players have functional solutions for emerging market chaotic traffic**. While $127B is invested globally in AV development, the $32B emerging market segment remains completely unserved due to technical and cultural barriers.

**Key Finding**: OSIRIS enters a market with established giants but **zero direct competition** in our target segment.
